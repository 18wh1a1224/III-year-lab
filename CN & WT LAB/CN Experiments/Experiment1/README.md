# Experiment1

## Aim of the Experiment
1. character counting
2. bit stuffing
3. character stuffing

### step by step procedure of experiment
character counting procedure
1. First we need to declare number of frames we required.
2. Then we need to scan the frames.
3. After scaning we need to find string length of the each frames.
4. Then printing the frames at sender.
5. printing the Data Transmitted.
6. After that printing the frames at receiver.

### Output
